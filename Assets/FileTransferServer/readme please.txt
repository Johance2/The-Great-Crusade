Hi, first of all: thank you for purchasing FileTransferServer.
I'm sure it will make your developer's life easier.

Then: Before start with the application, please drag the "StreamingAssets" folder outside the "FileTransferServer" folder.

The "StreamingAssets" folder is a special Unity fodler, you know? It must be right in the "Assets" folder, otherwise Unity will not find it.

Please take a look at the documentation.

Thanks again.
